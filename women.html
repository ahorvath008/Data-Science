<h1> Women in the Workforce Analytics </h1>

<p> Purpose: The purpose of the following analysis is to analyse womens' labour participation and its impact on political stability. </p>

<p> Data: The data source is a combination of the UN's women enterpreneurship data, alimented by country-specific economic and transparency indicators from the World Bank.  </p>

 <h1> Key Findings and Conclusions  </h1>
 
 1. Though Women's Enterpreneuriship Index (WEI) is markedly higher in developed countries, there are certain cases where a developing country's WEI is higher or very similar to that of a developed country.  These cases are as follows and may warrant further analysis.  We surmise these may relate to more traditional gender roles in East Asia and Southern Europe:

*   Developed countries with the lowest WEI scores:

    > Japan (40), Greece (43), Croatia (49), Italy (51), Spain (52)

*   Developing countries with highest WEI Scores:

   > Uruguay (44), Peru (43), Mexico (42)
 

<p> 2. Surprisingly, there is weak correlation between the Women's Enterpreneurship Index and Female Labour Force Participation (0.44). This might be explained by women potentially taking on non-enterpreneurial roles. We found that this weak correlation existed in both developing and developed countries. </p>
 
 <p> 3. We note that both the Women's Enterpreneurship Index as well as the female labour force participation had an impact on political stability, the former was found to have a stronger impact.

    Women Enterpreneurship Index (0.75)
    Female Labour Force Participation (0.62)
